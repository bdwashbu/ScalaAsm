Scala x86 ![Alt text](/example/smooth-spiral.png)
========

Welcome to the best Scala source for all things [x86-64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86), [Portable Executable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable) (.exe), and [COFF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COFF) (.o)!

Scala x86 is a back-end for a compiler.  Its a collection of libraries that one could write a programming language with.

ScalaAsm is a simple low-level assembly API.  It uses the lower level libraries to assemble code into a object file and then link it into an executable for windows 32 or 64-bit platforms.  What makes ScalaAsm special is the amount of compile time safety within the API.

#### Implementing x86

Intel and others have worked on x86 since 1978 and it has grown into a very large instruction set.  There are around 700 instructions and each one could have up to 35 different types of inputs!  To put this into programming terms - most instructions are overloaded at least a couple times.  There are around 1300 instructions needing to be implemented if you want to be thorough.  The Intel x86 spec is 3300 pages, after all.

For the implementers, Scala x86 strives to make the process of defining instructions as easy and simple as possible.  It was designed for this.  It resembles the Intel specification at all times.  When you have thousands of definitions like this, strong type safety and consise notation really help reduce the chance of errors.  Scala x86 provides this, which is useful because there are still thousands of instructions that have yet to be implemented.

For the users, Scala x86 offers compile-time safety.  If bad operand types are passed into an instruction the Scala compiler will see this and flag an error, using type classes. 

##### Instructions

Heres an example of some PUSH instructions for 64-bit register, 16-bit register, 8-bit immediate value, and 16-bit immediate value operands.

```scala
implicit object push1 extends PUSH._1[r64, O] {
  def opcode = 0x50 + rd
}

implicit object push2 extends PUSH._1[r16, O] {
  def opcode = 0x50 + rw
}
  
implicit object push3 extends PUSH._1[imm8, I] {
  def opcode = 0x6A
}
  
implicit object push4 extends PUSH._1[imm16, I] {
  def opcode = 0x68
}
```

[See more instructions](/x86/src/main/scala/com/scalaAsm/x86/Instructions/Standard "More instructions")

Here we see PUSH definitions straight from the Intel x86 specification, and we see that the definitions look similiar. The "Op/En" field is very important here. As seen in the code above, Op/En along with only the opcode sometimes gives us enough information to completely define the instruction!

The "Op/En" field is an abbreviation for the type of expected operands e.g "I" means either imm8, imm16, or imm32.

Assuming those are the only versions of PUSH available, if you tried calling:

```scala
push(ecx)
```

It would be a compile time error because there is no PUSH implementation defined that takes a single 32-bit register.

### ScalaAsm

The hope is that Scala x86 can be used to implement a turing-complete programming language, but this is still an area of research.

Scala x86 can be used to implement low-level assembly code. ScalaAsm currently supports many useful features such as procedures, loops, labels, and variables.  Some of these, like variables, are implemented using scala code.

Heres a short 32-bit windows console version of "Hello world!":

```scala
object HelloWorld extends AsmProgram[x86_32] {
  
  dataSections += new DataSection {
    builder += Variable("helloWorld", "Hello World!\r\n\0")
    builder += Variable("pressAnyKey", "Press any key to continue ...\r\n\0")
  }

  codeSections += new CodeSection {
    
    val STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE = byte(-11)
    val STD_INPUT_HANDLE = byte(-10)

    procedure(name = "start",
      push("helloWorld"),
      call("printf"),
      pop(ebx),
      push("pressAnyKey"),
      call("printf"),
      pop(ebx),
      push(STD_INPUT_HANDLE),
      call("GetStdHandle"),
      push(eax),
      call("FlushConsoleInputBuffer"),
      call("_getch"),
      retn
    )
  }
}
```

Heres code to build and output the executable:

```scala
val obj = assembler.assemble(HelloWorld)
val exe = linker.link(obj, 0x2000, is64Bit=false, "kernel32.dll", "msvcrt.dll")

val outputStream = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("test.exe"));
outputStream.write(exe.get)
outputStream.close
```

How to run:
========

1. Launch sbt
2. type 'project example'
3. type 'run'
4. Observe 'test.exe' get generated
5. Execute 'test.exe'

Output:
```
Hello World!
Press any key to continue ...
```

How to build:
========

1. Launch sbt
2. Run the 'eclipse' command to rebuild all .classpath and .project files
3. In Eclipse, under window->preferences->general->workspace->build order, uncheck 'use default order' and set the order from top to bottom: x86, coff, asm, assembler, portableExe, linker, example
4. Refresh/Clean projects in eclipse
